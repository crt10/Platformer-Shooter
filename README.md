- Variable jump height based on duration of jump input
- Player can fire bullets in 4 directions (left/right/up/down) based on movement input
- Collision system with support for sloped surfaces
- Player and enemy state machines
- Enemies approach player once within a specific radius
- Unique enemy behavior depending on proximity of the player
- Player and enemy health
